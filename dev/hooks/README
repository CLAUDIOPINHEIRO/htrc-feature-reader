These are the git hooks for development. Put them in .git/hooks.

Post-commit checks if an iPython Readme notebook was committed, and if so, it
generates a markdown version and appends it to the last commit.

Pre-push starts a virtualenv environment, installs the Feature Reader for both
Python2 and Python3, and runs tests.
